Thanks for your attention. There are a few things needed to be clarified before using. 

Aim - To calculate how much carbon dioxide different regions and sectors are responsible for based on what they consume
Tool - Pymrio Python library 
Data - 2023 Carbon emission data from _Carbon Monitor_ (https://carbonmonitor.org/) and IO packages from _EXIOBASE 3.8.2_ (https://zenodo.org/records/14614930)
Aggregation Rule - Combine detailed economic sectors and geographic regions based on _Carbon Monitor_ 
Calculation Rule - The Leontief inverse matrix 
Output - A table of consumption-based COâ‚‚ emissions by integrating regional-and-sector economic data in the year of 2023

Other year functions as the same. Welcome to hear your suggestion.
